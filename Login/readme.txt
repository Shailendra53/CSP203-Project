I had created discussion forum which has login page as default page.
Login page has a button to register.
The default page after login page consists of links for members registered,my account tab to know/change account details and list of posts with details pertaining to post.
If you click on the post name it will redirect you to the particular post.
which has details of comments pertaining to that post.
There is a link to add comment which checks if you are posting it to the correct post or not by requesting you to type in the post id.
